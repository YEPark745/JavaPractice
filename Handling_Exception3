/* Consider the following class:
public class Store {
public final double SALES_TAX_RATE = 0.06;
private String name;
public Store1(String name ){
setName( name );
}
public String getName(){
return name;
}
public void setName(String name ){
this.name = name;
}
public String toString(){
return("Name: " + name );
}
}
create a class encapsulating a Mobile store, which inherits from Store. 
A Mobile store has the following additional attributes: its annual sale and the number of hand-sets sold on monthly basis. 
Code the constructor and the toString method of the new class; also code a method returning the average selling price for hand-set, 
and another method to show the month in which the most hand-set sale has been experienced. You also need to include a client class to test your code. */
